[WARNING] 
[WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for com.google.code.gson:gson-extras:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT
[WARNING] 'parent.relativePath' of POM com.google.code.gson:gson-extras:1.0-SNAPSHOT (/tmp/dspot-experiments/dataset/april-2019/gson_parent/extras/pom.xml) points at com.google.code.gson:gson-parent instead of org.sonatype.oss:oss-parent, please verify your project structure @ line 9, column 11
[WARNING] 
[WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.
[WARNING] 
[WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.
