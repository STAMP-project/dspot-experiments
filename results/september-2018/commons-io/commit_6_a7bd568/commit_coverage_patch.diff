-These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Commons-IO from
-version 2.2 to version 2.3
-<source>
-Commons IO is a package of Java utility classes like java.io.  
-Classes in this package are considered to be so standard and of such high 
-reuse as to justify existence in java.io.
-
-The Commons IO library contains utility classes, stream implementations, file filters, 
-file comparators, endian transformation classes, and much more.

-==============================================================================
-Apache Commons IO Version 2.3-SNAPSHOT
-==============================================================================
-
-Changes in this version include:
-
-New features:
-o IO-322:  Add and use class Charsets. Thanks to ggregory. 
-o IO-321:  ByteOrderMark UTF_32LE is incorrect. Thanks to ggregory. 
-o IO-318:  Add Charset sister APIs to method that take a String charset name. Thanks to ggregory.
