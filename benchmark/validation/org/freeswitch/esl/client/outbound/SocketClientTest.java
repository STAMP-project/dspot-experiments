/**
 * This 'test' is not really a unit test, more an integration test. In order to see
 * any result, configure a FreeSWITCH installation with an extension something like
 * the following:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;extension&gt;
 * &lt;condition field="destination_number" expresssion="444"&gt;
 * &lt;action application="socket" data="192.168.100.88:8084 async full"/&gt;
 * &lt;/condition&gt;
 * &lt;/extension&gt;
 * <pre>
 * Replace the ip address with the host that FreeSWITCH sees that you are running the test on, perhaps
 * localhost.
 * <p/>
 * Run the test, you have 45 seconds to make a call to extension 444 and observe the logs.
