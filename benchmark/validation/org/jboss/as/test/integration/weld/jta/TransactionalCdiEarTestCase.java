/**
 * Tests that the Transactional annotation works in a CDI Bean which is in an ear deployment.
 * <p>
 * This is a test case for WFLY-11506 that requires standalone.xml server configuration. Notice that if you are using
 * -Dtest= system property to run this test, the result could end up in a false negative because Wildfly uses
 * standalone-full.xml configuration file to run individual tests, and this variant includes the org.jboss.jts module in
 * the ear classpath via MessagingDependencyProcessor, making the issue not reproducible.
