/**
 * Hibernate generates the wrong alias on a Criteria query involving a join
 * on a composite identifier. For example, in the test below without the fix
 * to JoinWalker, it generates this SQL:
 *
 * <code>
 * select
 * this_.role_code as role1_0_1_,
 * this_.is_deleted as is2_0_1_,
 * this_.record_version as record3_0_1_,
 * complexjoi3_.code as code1_0_,
 * complexjoi3_.is_deleted as is2_1_0_,
 * complexjoi3_.record_version as record3_1_0_
 * from
 * list_action_roles this_
 * left outer join
 * roles complexjoi3_
 * on this_.role_code=complexjoi3_.code
 * where
 * this_.is_deleted=?
 * and complexjoi1_.is_deleted=?
 * </code>
 *
 * Which results in this error from the SQL server:
 *
 * <code>
 * Unknown column 'complexjoi1_.is_deleted' in 'where clause'
 * </code>
 *
 * Analysis of the problem:
 *
 * The entity persister class with the composite identifier has a fake
 * property for it, called "_identifierMapper" (see HbmBinder.bindCompositeId()
 * and similarly in Annotations). This property name ends up in the path
 * used by JoinWalker.walkEntityTree() when it calls walkComponentTree().
 * However that path is used by CriteriaJoinWalker.generateTableAlias()
 * to look up the correct criteria (and hence the alias) from the
 * translator, a CriteriaQueryTranslator.
 *
 * The alias was created in CriteriaQueryTranslator.createCriteriaSQLAliasMap
 * for a Criteria without this extra _identifierMapper path component.
 * So when CriteriaJoinWalker tries to use the path with _identifierMapper
 * to look up the criteria to find the correct alias to use, in
 * generateTableAlias(), it doesn't find one, so it generates a new alias.
 *
 * That new alias no longer matches the one that will be rendered out in
 * the WHERE clause, so the WHERE clause will refer to table names using
 * aliases that are not used anywhere else in the query, and the SQL server
 * will fail to parse the statement.
 *
 * The solution appears to be to exclude "_identifierMapper" components in
 * the alias path when building it. I don't know what other implications
 * that might have, but it seems like an implementation nastiness that
 * shouldn't be exposed.
