/**
 * Test JPA 2.0 section 7.6.2.1

 * Inheritance of Extended Persistence Context
 * <p>
 * "
 * If a stateful session bean instantiates a stateful session bean (executing in the same EJB container instance)
 * which also has such an extended persistence context, the extended persistence context of the first stateful
 * session bean is inherited by the second stateful session bean and bound to it, and this rule recursively
 * applies?independently of whether transactions are active or not at the point of the creation of the stateful
 * session beans.
 * "
 * <p>
 * This tests the "shallow" inheritance where the above only applies to parent/child relationships (not recursively
 * up and vertically which is "deep" inheritance).
