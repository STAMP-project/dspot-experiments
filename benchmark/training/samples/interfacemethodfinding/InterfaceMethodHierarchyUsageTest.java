/**
 * There was a bug in PowerMock 1.2 and its predecessors that made PowerMock
 * {@link WhiteboxImpl#getMethod(Class, Class...)} fail when invoking proxified
 * interface methods declared in extended interfaces. E.g. if interface A
 * extends B & C and a method was declared in B it wouldn't be found by
 * {@link WhiteboxImpl#getMethod(Class, Class...)} since it only used to
 * traverse the class hierarchy and not the structure of the extended
 * interfaces. This was fixed in version 1.3 and this test demonstrates that
 * it's solved.
 * <p>
 * Thanks to Lokesh Vaddi for finding this bug and to provide an example.
