/**
 * <strong>Problem 30: Digit fifth powers</strong>
 * <p>
 * Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
 * fourth powers of their digits:
 * <pre>
 * 1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
 * 8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
 * 9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4
 * </pre>
 *
 * As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.
 * <p>
 * The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 * <p>
 * Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
 * powers of their digits.
 * <p>
